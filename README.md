# egfr_inhibiton

# Overview
This repository egfr_inhibition related to the paper titled "Molecular Insights of EGFR/HER2 Inhibition by Lapatinib and Emerging HER2-Mutant Kinase Inhibitors" contains the input scripts to run the conventional MD and FM simulations.

The clustered_structure folder displays the pdb files obtained after clustering the simulation trajectories.

The bounded structures folder shows the pdb files of EGFR_inhibitor complexes within range of 1 kcal/mol < PMF (kcal/mol) < 4 kcal/mol
